GNOME Shell extension to change brightness levels with a mouse scroll over the battery icon.

## Contributions welcome 
I have never built a GNOME Shell extension and hence would appreciate any help and feedback from experienced developers. Envisioned workflow is as follows:

1. User uses mouse scroll wheel over the battery icon
2. Display brightness level changes
3. Visual notification is shown to inform user about brightness change

This should function analogously to the volume change on mouse scroll wheel over the volume icon.
